# ZumoWarm

This Arduino sketch simulates the warming up of sumo wrestlers before the
combat. 

It's a simple test to confirm that motor and buzzer connections are right in 
the Zumo Shield. Verify first step is with the right track and a beep is
generated in between of right-left cycles (right-left-beep and so on).
